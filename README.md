# Dolphin - Focus Guardian App

Dolphin 1.0 is a focus-guarding Android application designed to help students build healthier phone habits in an environment filled with digital distractions. The app monitors usage patterns in real time, identifies distraction-heavy apps, and offers timely nudges that are personalised to the student’s goals, sleep routine, and future-self description. The intention is to blend behavioural science with practical mobile engineering so that users receive reminders that feel relevant, humane, and effective, rather than intrusive.

The app is built in Java and runs on Android 8.0 (API 26) and above, targeting the latest SDK for modern device compatibility. The architecture is clean and maintainable, with separate layers for data handling, domain models, notification logic, background monitoring, and UI flows. The core of the system is a foreground service that continuously tracks app usage through Android’s Usage Stats API, while the in-house NudgeEngine generates context-aware notifications based on strictness levels and sleep schedules. All processing is fully offline, keeping user data private and the experience reliable even without internet access.

Dolphin’s onboarding flow asks students to articulate their goals, describe their ideal future self, and choose the apps they find distracting. Based on these inputs, the system adapts its behaviour through three strictness modes that range from gentle reminders to firmer, identity-based interventions. The user interface is crafted with XML layouts following Material Design 3, ensuring a modern experience that feels familiar to Android users while remaining lightweight and responsive.

From an engineering standpoint, the project demonstrates practical mobile development skills: structured package organisation, clean separation of concerns, efficient use of Android services, and responsible permission handling for usage access, notifications, and foreground operations. The build process is standardised through Gradle and supports easy generation of debug APKs for testing and deployment. Dolphin 1.0 aims to serve as both a meaningful productivity tool for students and a showcase of thoughtful Android engineering aligned with industry expectations.
