Dolphin 1.0 is a focus-guarding Android application designed to help students build healthier phone habits in an environment filled with digital distractions. The app monitors usage patterns in real time, identifies distraction-heavy apps, and offers timely nudges that are personalised to the student’s goals, sleep routine and future-self description. The intention is to blend behavioural science with practical mobile engineering so that users receive reminders that feel relevant, humane and effective, rather than intrusive.
